            <p>Welcome to the Catanities' page! We're a very cool and evil club that loves cats! I, Celeste Shi,
                am the leader. The silly little creatures we worship are my cats, who are named Llama and Octopuss! They
                are two very very very jolly
                little fellows! Many members of IMD are currently in the club, and we encourage you to join!! However,
                if you're on the fence, perhaps try clicking on the red button at the very bottom of this page for an
                answer from a magic 8 ball. It'll help you decide whether joining is the best idea for you!</p>

            <p class="bold">What it's like serving them:</p>
            <p>Really awesome most of the time. They're very nice and chill and just want to hang out with people!
                However. Beware. At night, one of them can get a little quirky. Llama will attack her favourite people
                (me) every night before bed because she's scary and evil sometimes (hooray!). She also likes to jump on and off of people's
                (mine) beds repeatedly so they can't sleep. Octopuss is pretty awesome but also not very smart. He likes
                to go outside a bunch and tries to make friends with the other cats in our neighbourhood. I think they
                like him? But they might also think he's a little odd. One time he followed another cat while walking on the fence very very
                slowly for like 10 minutes. I don't know why.</p>
